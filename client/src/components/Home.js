            <p>React Router is a standard library for routing in React. It enables the navigation among views of various components in a React Application, allows changing the browser URL, and keeps the UI in sync with the URL.
                Let us create a simple application to React to understand how the React Router works. The application will contain three components: home component, about a component, and contact component. We will use React Router to navigate between these components.</p>
            <p> Setting up the React Application: Create a React application using create-react-app and lets call it geeks.
                Note: If youâ€™ve previously installed create-react-app globally via npm, directly use the command below:</p>
        </div>
    )
}

export default Home
